        <h3>Mango</h3>
        <img src="mango.jpg" alt="This is image of mango"><p><strong>Description:</strong> A <strong>mango</strong> is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It is believed to have originated in
        the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated in South
        and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the
        "Southeast Asian type". Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called
        <strong>"mangoes"</strong>, the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion</p>

        <p><strong>Description: </strong> A <strong>banana</strong> is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous
        flowering plants in the genus Musa.In some countries, <strong>bananas</strong> used for cooking may be called "plantains",
        distinguishing them from dessert <strong>bananas</strong>. The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated
        and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when

        <p><strong>Description: </strong> A <strong>grape</strong> is a fruit, botanically a berry, of the deciduous woody vines of the flowering plant genus Vitis. <strong>Grapes</strong> are a
        non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.
        
        <strong>Grapes</strong> have played an important role in human nutrition, and have great cultural significance as well. The cultivation
        of grapes started perhaps 8,000 years ago, in the Middle East, and the oldest known winery, in Armenia, dates to ca.
        4000 BCE, and they can be eaten fresh, they can be dried (as raisins, currants and sultanas), and they can be used for

        <p><strong>Description: </strong> <strong>Apple</strong> trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in
        Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. <strong>Apples</strong> have been grown for thousands of
        years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. <strong>Apples</strong> have religious and mythological
        significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.</p>
